<h1>Jhansi Lakshmi Bai</h1>
<body><p><b>Lakshmibai Newalkar</b>, the <b>Rani of Jhansi</b> (pronunciationⓘ; born Manikarnika Tambe; <b>19 November 1828 — 18 June 1858</b>),[1][2] was the Maharani consort of the princely state of Jhansi in Maratha Empire from <b>1843 to 1853</b> by marriage to<b> Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar</b>. She was one of the leading figures in the Indian Rebellion of<b> 1857</b>, who became a national hero and symbol of resistance to the British rule in India for Indian nationalists.On <b>17 June</b> in <b>Kotah-ki-Serai</b> near the Phool Bagh of Gwalior, a squadron of the 8th <b>(King's Royal Irish)</b> Hussars, under Captain Heneage, fought the large Indian force commanded by Rani Lakshmibai, who was trying to leave the area. The <b>8th Hussars</b> charged into the Indian force, slaughtering <b>5,000</b> Indian soldiers, including any Indian "<b>over the age of 16</b>".[42] They took two guns and continued the charge right through the Phool Bagh encampment. In this engagement, according to an <b>eyewitness account</b>, Rani Lakshmibai put on a sowar's uniform and attacked one of the hussars; she was unhorsed and also wounded, probably by his saber. Shortly afterward, as she sat bleeding by the roadside, she recognized the soldier and fired at him with a pistol, whereupon he "dispatched the young lady with his <b>carbine</b>".</p>
    <p>Born into a <b>Karhada Brahmin</b> family in <b>Banares</b>, Lakshmibai married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, in <b>1842</b>. When the Maharaja died in <b>1853</b>, the British East India Company under Governor-General <b>Lord Dalhousie</b> refused to recognize the claim of his adopted heir and annexed Jhansi under the<b> Doctrine of Lapse</b>. The Rani was unwilling to cede control and joined the rebellion against the British in <b>1857</b>. She led the successful defense of Jhansi against Company allies, but in early <b>1858</b> Jhansi fell to British forces under the command of <b>Hugh Rose</b>. The Rani managed to escape on horseback and joined the rebels in capturing Gwalior, where they proclaimed <b>Nana Saheb </b>as Peshwa of the revived Maratha Empire. She died in <b>June 1858</b> after being mortally wounded during the British counterattack at Gwalior.</p>

<h3>History of Jhansi Lakshmi Bai</h3>
<p><b>Manikarnika</b> was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May <b>1842</b>[3][18] and was afterward called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honor of the <b>Hindu goddess Devi Lakshmi</b> and according to the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In <b>September 1851</b>, she gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth due to a chronic illness. The Maharaja adopted a child called <b>Anand Rao</b>, the son of <b>Gangadhar Rao's</b> cousin, who was renamed<b> Damodar Rao</b>, on the day before the Maharaja died.[19] The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime.</p>
